In Getting Things GNOME! (GTG), everything is a task. From building a bridge over the Pacific Ocean to changing a light bulb or organizing a party!\n\nIf you are new to GTG, please take the time to read this, as it will provide you useful information about how to use GTG to organize your everyday life.\n\nCreating and editing tasks:\n\nUsing GTG is easy: you organize what you have to do by creating new tasks. To do this, simply press the &quot;New Task&quot; button, edit the task by describing it, set some parameters, and that's it! Once a task done, you can close it by pressing the &quot;Mark As Done&quot; button.\n\nIn GTG, a task is automatically saved while you are editing it. No need to press any &quot;Save&quot; button! Try it: add some text to this task, close the window, and reopen it: your changes are still there!\n\nAbout subtasks:\n\nIn life, you often get more things done by refining them in smaller, more operational tasks. GTG helps to do just this by defining  &quot;subtasks&quot;. In GTG, those subtasks are considered as prerequisites that must be completed before being able to close their parent task.\n\nTherefore, in GTG, a task might host one or several subtasks. Those appear as links in the task description, just like the link below. To open and edit a subtask, simply click on its link! Try it yourself: open the following subtask:\n<subtask>1@1</subtask>\n\nClosing a task:\n\nIn GTG, once you are done with a task, you can close it by pushing either the &quot;Mark as Done&quot; or the &quot;Dismiss&quot; button. Use the first one if the task is done, and the latter if you want to close it because it is not relevant anymore. Want to try it? Try to close the subtask above for instance!\n\nWhen you close a task, you will notice that all its subtasks will be automatically closed too! Indeed, GTG considers that if you have completed a given task, then you don't need to do its subtasks anymore (they were prerequisites, after all).\n\nNote that the tasks that you have marked as done or dismissed are listed in the &quot;Closed Tasks Pane&quot; which is hidden by default, but you can easily show it using the View menu.\n\nLearn more about GTG:\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about GTG's other features, you will find more information here:\n<subtask>2@1</subtask>\n<subtask>3@1</subtask>\n<subtask>4@1</subtask>\n<subtask>5@1</subtask>\n<subtask>6@1</subtask>\n<subtask>7@1</subtask>\n<subtask>8@1</subtask>\n\nYou can also browse GTG documentation by pressing F1 or opening it using the Help menu.\n\nWe sincerely hope you will enjoy using GTG, and thank you for trying it out! Please send us bug reports and ideas for improvement using this web page: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+filebug If you want to get tips for using GTG or be informed about the newest features, also visit our blog at http://gtg.fritalk.com\n\nThe GTG team.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use Subtasks":[null,"Learn How To Use Subtasks"],"A &quot;Subtask&quot; is something that you need to do first before being able to accomplish your task.

It's very useful when you want to get things done and to focus on the relevant tasks!\n\nIf you use tags, you can right click on a tag in the sidebar and choose to hide tasks assigned to this particular tag in the Work View. It is very useful if you have a tag like &quot;@wait&quot; that you use for tasks blocked by some external event (i.e. a phone call you wait to receive).\n\nAnd finally, an important note regarding the Work View: since the Work View is updated instantaneously, if you edit your task while using the Work View, this task might disappear due to the change you just made (e.g. adding a subtask, adding a tag hidden in the Work View, etc.).
