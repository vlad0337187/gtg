In Getting Things GNOME! (GTG), everything is a task. From building a bridge over the Pacific Ocean to changing a light bulb or organizing a party!\n\nIf you are new to GTG, please take the time to read this, as it will provide you useful information about how to use GTG to organize your everyday life.\n\nCreating and editing tasks:\n\nUsing GTG is easy: you organize what you have to do by creating new tasks. To do this, simply press the &quot;New Task&quot; button, edit the task by describing it, set some parameters, and that's it! Once a task done, you can close it by pressing the &quot;Mark As Done&quot; button.\n\nIn GTG, a task is automatically saved while you are editing it. No need to press any &quot;Save&quot; button! Try it: add some text to this task, close the window, and reopen it: your changes are still there!\n\nAbout subtasks:\n\nIn life, you often get more things done by refining them in smaller, more operational tasks. GTG helps to do just this by defining  &quot;subtasks&quot;. In GTG, those subtasks are considered as prerequisites that must be completed before being able to close their parent task.\n\nTherefore, in GTG, a task might host one or several subtasks. Those appear as links in the task description, just like the link below. To open and edit a subtask, simply click on its link! Try it yourself: open the following subtask:\n<subtask>1@1</subtask>\n\nClosing a task:\n\nIn GTG, once you are done with a task, you can close it by pushing either the &quot;Mark as Done&quot; or the &quot;Dismiss&quot; button. Use the first one if the task is done, and the latter if you want to close it because it is not relevant anymore. Want to try it? Try to close the subtask above for instance!\n\nWhen you close a task, you will notice that all its subtasks will be automatically closed too! Indeed, GTG considers that if you have completed a given task, then you don't need to do its subtasks anymore (they were prerequisites, after all).\n\nNote that the tasks that you have marked as done or dismissed are listed in the &quot;Closed Tasks Pane&quot; which is hidden by default, but you can easily show it using the View menu.\n\nLearn more about GTG:\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about GTG's other features, you will find more information here:\n<subtask>2@1</subtask>\n<subtask>3@1</subtask>\n<subtask>4@1</subtask>\n<subtask>5@1</subtask>\n<subtask>6@1</subtask>\n<subtask>7@1</subtask>\n<subtask>8@1</subtask>\n\nYou can also browse GTG documentation by pressing F1 or opening it using the Help menu.\n\nWe sincerely hope you will enjoy using GTG, and thank you for trying it out! Please send us bug reports and ideas for improvement using this web page: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+filebug If you want to get tips for using GTG or be informed about the newest features, also visit our blog at http://gtg.fritalk.com\n\nThe GTG team.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use Subtasks":[null,""],"A &quot;Subtask&quot; is something that you need to do first before being able to accomplish your task. In GTG, the purpose of subtasks is to cut down a task in smaller subtasks that are easier to achieve and to track down.\n\nTo insert a subtask in the task description (this window, for instance), begin a line with &quot;-&quot;, then write the subtask title and press Enter.\n\nTry inserting one subtask below. Type &quot;- This is my first subtask!&quot;, for instance, and press Enter:\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the &quot;Insert Subtask&quot; button.\n\nNote that subtasks obey to some rules: first, a subtask's due date can never happen after its parent's due date and, second, when you mark a parent task as done, its subtasks will also be marked as done.\n\nAnd if you are not happy with your current tasks/subtasks organization, you can always change it by drag-and-dropping tasks on each other in the tasks list.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use Tags":[null,""],"In GTG, you use tags to sort your tasks. A tag is a simple word that begins with &quot;@&quot;.\n\nTry to type a word beginning with &quot;@&quot; here:\n\nOnce it becomes yellow, it is a tag! And this tag is now linked to the task!\n\nUsing the View menu, you can enable a sidebar which displays all the tags you are using. This allows you to easily see all tasks associated to a given tag.\n\nIf you right-click on a tag in the sidebar, you can also edit it. It allows you to assign it a color or an icon for instance. This is handy if you want to quickly identify the tasks associated to a given tag in the task list!\n\nNew tags are always added exclusively to the currently edited task, and never to its subtasks. However, when you create a new subtask, it will inherit its parent's tags.\n\nIf you need a more advanced task organization, you can also create a hierarchy of tags by drag-and-dropping a tag onto another. This is useful when you want to regroup several tags together and see all related tasks easily. For instance, if you have two tags @money and @to_pay, and you drag @to_pay on @money, every task tagged with @to_pay will also appear when you select @money.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use The Work View":[null,""],"If you press the &quot;Work View&quot; button, only actionable tasks will be displayed in your list.\n\nWhat is an actionable task? It's a task you can do directly, right now.\n\nIt's a task that is already &quot;start-able&quot;, i.e. the start date is already over.\n\nIt's a task that doesn't have open subtasks, i.e. you can do the task itself directly.\n\nIt's a task that has a due date different than &quot;Someday&quot;, since this kind of date is reserved for things that needs more thoughts before being actionable.\n\nThus, in short, the Work View shows you tasks that you can do right now. It's very useful when you want to get things done and to focus on the relevant tasks!\n\nIf you use tags, you can right click on a tag in the sidebar and choose to hide tasks assigned to this particular tag in the Work View. It is very useful if you have a tag like &quot;@wait&quot; that you use for tasks blocked by some external event (i.e. a phone call you wait to receive).\n\nAnd finally, an important note regarding the Work View: since the Work View is updated instantaneously, if you edit your task while using the Work View, this task might disappear due to the change you just made (e.g. adding a subtask, adding a tag hidden in the Work View, etc.). To avoid this, it's better not to edit your task while using the Work View. ":[null,""],"Learn How To Use Plugins":[null,""],"GTG has the ability to add plugins to extend its core functionality.\n\nSome examples of the currently available plugins are the notification icon which displays a handy shortcut to GTG in your notification space, or the closed tasks remover which automatically deletes old tasks from your closed tasks list.\n\nYou can find the Plugin Manager by selecting Edit in the Menu Bar, then clicking Plugins.":[null,""],"Reporting Bugs":[null,""],"GTG is still beta software.

Any contribution, any idea is welcome!\n\nIf you have some trouble with GTG, we might be able to help you or to solve your problem really quickly.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use The Quick Add Entry":[null,""],"The Quick Add Entry is the fastest way to create a new task. Use the check box in the View menu to enable and disable the entry field.\n\nTo add a task simply type its title in the entry and press Enter. The task will be created and selected in the task browser. If a tag is selected in the Tags Sidebar, it will be applied to the task you created.\n\nYou can also create a task in the Quick Add Entry and at the same time specify its tags, due and defer date. Follow these format rules:\n\ntags:tag1,tag2,tag3\n\nUsing this you can apply as many tags as you wish using comma as separator. Note that any word in the title that begins with &quot;@&quot; will also be interpreted as a tag!\n\ndue:date\ndefer:date\n\nUsing this you can apply a due date or a defer date. Dates can be formated as per your locale or yyyy-mm-dd (for example 2012-04-01) or yyyymmdd (20120401) or mmdd (0401 - the year being implicitly the current one) or today, tomorrow or a weekday name (due:monday means due next Monday). Dates which are added in this way will not appear in the task title.\n\nExamples:\n\nbuy stationary tags:purchases,office due:20120330 defer:tuesday\n\nThe above example tells GTG to create a new task with the title &quot;buy stationary&quot;, under the tags &quot;purchases&quot; and &quot;office&quot;, with the due date March 30, 2012 and the start date next Tuesday.\n\ncall mum tags:family,calls due:sunday defer:tomorrow\n\nThe above example tells GTG to create a new task with the title &quot;call mum&quot;, under the tags &quot;family&quot; and &quot;calls&quot;, with the due date next Sunday and the start date tomorrow.":[null,""],"Learn How To Use Synchronization Services":[null,""],"Synchronization Services allow GTG to synchronize (meaning to have access or to import) tasks, notes or bugs from other sites or services like Launchpad, Remember the Milk, Tomboy, etc.\n\nThis can incredibly useful if, for instance, you want to access your tasks on several instances of GTG running on separate computers, or if you want to edit your tasks using an online service. GTG can also import tasks from specific sites like launchpad for instance, which allows you to manage the bug reports you're working on in GTG!\n\nTo use Synchronization Services, use the Edit menu, and select &quot;Synchronization Services&quot;. You will then have the possibility to select among several online or local services from/to where you can import or export your tasks.\n\nIf you want to know more about Synchronization Services, you can read more about them by in the dedicated documentation in GTG's help (use the Help menu or press F1 to get access to it).":[null,""],"Learn How To Search For Tasks":[null,""],"To help you to find specific tasks more easily, GTG allows you to search for tasks based on their content.\n\nSearching for tasks is really easy: just type the words you are looking for in the Quick Add Entry, and select &quot;Search&quot; in the menu that will appear automatically.\n\nGTG stores your searches in the sidebar, under the &quot;Search&quot; section. You can thus always go back to a previous search need it. Search results are updated automatically, so you always get all the tasks matching your search request.\n\nGTG also saves all the search requests you have made until you explicitely delete them (which you can do by right-clicking on them and selecting &quot;Delete&quot;). That allows you to safely quit GTG without loosing your search requests. This can be very useful when you use the search features to identify specific tasks regularly!\n\nGTG search feature is really powerful and accept many parameters that allows you to search for very specific tasks. For instance, using the search query &quot;@errands !today&quot;, you can search for tasks with the @errands tag that must be done today. To learn more about those search query parameters, you can read the documentation available in GTG's help (press F1 or use the Help menu to get access to it).":[null,""],"My new task":[null,"Η νέα μου εργασία"],"tags":[null,"ετικέτες"],"tag":[null,"ετικέτα"],"defer":[null,""],"start":[null,"έναρξη"],"due":[null,"λήξη"],"Everything necessary to run this plugin is available.":[null,""],"The plugin can not be loaded":[null,"Αδυναμία φόρτωσης προσθέτου"],"Some python modules are missing":[null,"Μερικά αρθρώματα της python λείπουν"],"Please install the following python modules:":[null,"Παρακαλώ εγκαταστήστε τα παρακάτω αρθρώματα της python:"],"Some remote dbus objects are missing.":[null,""],"Please start the following applications:":[null,"Παρακαλώ εκκινήστε τις παρακάτω εφαρμογές:"],"Some modules and remote dbus objects are missing.":[null,""],"Please install or start the following components:":[null,"Παρακαλώ εγκαταστήστε ή εκκινήστε τα παρακάτω συστατικά:"],"Unknown error while loading the plugin.":[null,"Άγνωστο σφάλμα κατά την φόρτωση του πρόσθετου."],"Very helpful message, isn't it?
