        to accomplish your task. In GTG, the purpose of subtasks is to cut down a
        task in smaller subtasks that are easier to achieve and to track down.


        To insert a subtask in the task description (this window, for instance), begin
        a line with &quot;-&quot;, then write the subtask title and press Enter.


        Try inserting one subtask below. Type &quot;- This is my first subtask!&quot;,
        for instance, and press Enter:




        Alternatively, you can also use the &quot;Insert Subtask&quot; button.


        Note that subtasks obey to some rules: first, a subtask''s due date can never
        happen after its parent''s due date and, second, when you mark a parent task
        as done, its subtasks will also be marked as done.


        And if you are not happy with your current tasks/subtasks organization, you
        can always change it by drag-and-dropping tasks on each other in the tasks

    ? 'If you press the &quot;Work View&quot; button, only actionable tasks will be
        displayed in your list.


        What is an actionable task? It''s a task you can do directly, right now.


        It''s a task that is already &quot;start-able&quot;, i.e. the start date is
        already over.


        It''s a task that doesn''t have open subtasks, i.e. you can do the task itself
        directly.


        It''s a task that has a due date different than &quot;Someday&quot;, since
        this kind of date is reserved for things that needs more thoughts before being
        actionable.


        Thus, in short, the Work View shows you tasks that you can do right now. It''s
        very useful when you want to get things done and to focus on the relevant
        tasks!


        If you use tags, you can right click on a tag in the sidebar and choose to
        hide tasks assigned to this particular tag in the Work View. It is very useful
        if you have a tag like &quot;@wait&quot; that you use for tasks blocked by
        some external event (i.e. a phone call you wait to receive).


        And finally, an important note regarding the Work View: since the Work View
        is updated instantaneously, if you edit your task while using the Work View,
        this task might disappear due to the change you just made (e.g. adding a subtask,
        adding a tag hidden in the Work View, etc.). To avoid this, it''s better not
        to edit your task while using the Work View. '

        Try to type a word beginning with &quot;@&quot; here:


        Once it becomes yellow, it is a tag! And this tag is now linked to the task!


        Using the View menu, you can enable a sidebar which displays all the tags
        you are using. This allows you to easily see all tasks associated to a given
        tag.


        If you right-click on a tag in the sidebar, you can also edit it. It allows
        you to assign it a color or an icon for instance. This is handy if you want
        to quickly identify the tasks associated to a given tag in the task list!


        New tags are always added exclusively to the currently edited task, and never
        to its subtasks. However, when you create a new subtask, it will inherit its
        parent''s tags.


        If you need a more advanced task organization, you can also create a hierarchy
        of tags by drag-and-dropping a tag onto another. This is useful when you want
        to regroup several tags together and see all related tasks easily. For instance,
        if you have two tags @money and @to_pay, and you drag @to_pay on @money, every
        task tagged with @to_pay will also appear when you select @money.'

        to edit your tasks using an online service. GTG can also import tasks from
        specific sites like launchpad for instance, which allows you to manage the
        bug reports you''re working on in GTG!


        To use Synchronization Services, use the Edit menu, and select &quot;Synchronization
        Services&quot;. You will then have the possibility to select among several
        online or local services from/to where you can import or export your tasks.


        If you want to know more about Synchronization Services, you can read more
        about them by in the dedicated documentation in GTG''s help (use the Help
        menu or press F1 to get access to it).'

    ? 'The Quick Add Entry is the fastest way to create a new task. Use the check
        box in the View menu to enable and disable the entry field.


        To add a task simply type its title in the entry and press Enter. The task
        will be created and selected in the task browser. If a tag is selected in
        the Tags Sidebar, it will be applied to the task you created.


        You can also create a task in the Quick Add Entry and at the same time specify
        its tags, due and defer date. Follow these format rules:


        tags:tag1,tag2,tag3


        Using this you can apply as many tags as you wish using comma as separator.
        Note that any word in the title that begins with &quot;@&quot; will also be
        interpreted as a tag!


        due:date

        defer:date


        Using this you can apply a due date or a defer date. Dates can be formated
        as per your locale or yyyy-mm-dd (for example 2012-04-01) or yyyymmdd (20120401)
        or mmdd (0401 - the year being implicitly the current one) or today, tomorrow
        or a weekday name (due:monday means due next Monday). Dates which are added
        in this way will not appear in the task title.


        Examples:


        buy stationary tags:purchases,office due:20120330 defer:tuesday


        The above example tells GTG to create a new task with the title &quot;buy
        stationary&quot;, under the tags &quot;purchases&quot; and &quot;office&quot;,
        with the due date March 30, 2012 and the start date next Tuesday.


        call mum tags:family,calls due:sunday defer:tomorrow


        The above example tells GTG to create a new task with the title &quot;call

    ? 'To help you to find specific tasks more easily, GTG allows you to search for
        tasks based on their content.


        Searching for tasks is really easy: just type the words you are looking for
        in the Quick Add Entry, and select &quot;Search&quot; in the menu that will
        appear automatically.


        GTG stores your searches in the sidebar, under the &quot;Search&quot; section.
        You can thus always go back to a previous search need it. Search results are
        updated automatically, so you always get all the tasks matching your search
        request.


        GTG also saves all the search requests you have made until you explicitely
        delete them (which you can do by right-clicking on them and selecting &quot;Delete&quot;).
        That allows you to safely quit GTG without loosing your search requests. This
        can be very useful when you use the search features to identify specific tasks
        regularly!


        GTG search feature is really powerful and accept many parameters that allows
        you to search for very specific tasks. For instance, using the search query
        &quot;@errands !today&quot;, you can search for tasks with the @errands tag
        that must be done today. To learn more about those search query parameters,
        you can read the documentation available in GTG''s help (press F1 or use the

    ? 'Welcome to Getting Things GNOME!, your new task manager! In Getting Things
        GNOME! (GTG), everything is a task. From building a bridge over the Pacific
        Ocean to changing a light bulb or organizing a party!


        If you are new to GTG, please take the time to read this, as it will provide
        you useful information about how to use GTG to organize your everyday life.


        Creating and editing tasks:


        Using GTG is easy: you organize what you have to do by creating new tasks.
        To do this, simply press the &quot;New Task&quot; button, edit the task by
        describing it, set some parameters, and that''s it! Once a task done, you
        can close it by pressing the &quot;Mark As Done&quot; button.


        In GTG, a task is automatically saved while you are editing it. No need to
        press any &quot;Save&quot; button! Try it: add some text to this task, close
        the window, and reopen it: your changes are still there!


        About subtasks:


        In life, you often get more things done by refining them in smaller, more
        operational tasks. GTG helps to do just this by defining  &quot;subtasks&quot;.
        In GTG, those subtasks are considered as prerequisites that must be completed
        before being able to close their parent task.


        Therefore, in GTG, a task might host one or several subtasks. Those appear
        as links in the task description, just like the link below. To open and edit
        a subtask, simply click on its link! Try it yourself: open the following subtask:

        <subtask>1@1</subtask>


        Closing a task:


        In GTG, once you are done with a task, you can close it by pushing either
        the &quot;Mark as Done&quot; or the &quot;Dismiss&quot; button. Use the first
        one if the task is done, and the latter if you want to close it because it
        is not relevant anymore. Want to try it? Try to close the subtask above for
        instance!


        When you close a task, you will notice that all its subtasks will be automatically
        closed too! Indeed, GTG considers that if you have completed a given task,
        then you don''t need to do its subtasks anymore (they were prerequisites,
        after all).


        Note that the tasks that you have marked as done or dismissed are listed in
        the &quot;Closed Tasks Pane&quot; which is hidden by default, but you can
        easily show it using the View menu.
